This phenomenon becomes evident when the model performs exceptionally well on the training set but poorly on unseen data, such as a test set. Overfitting is likely to happen when the model captures the noise in the data instead of the true underlying pattern. In our context, we aim for the model to accurately generalize the overall pattern of the data, enabling it to correctly classify whether a potential client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. In the provided examples, it's probable that the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest classifiers are overfitting, as indicated by their nearly perfect accuracy scores of 100% and 99%, respectively.")

For example, if we split it into three parts, two-thirds (66%) of the data are used for training, and the remaining one-third (33%) is reserved for testing. This process is repeated multiple times, iterating through different training and test sets. The overarching goal of cross-validation is to capture the general pattern of the data by systematically varying the training and test data.")

However, this increased selectivity may cause the model to miss instances where it's less certain but still correct. For instance, if the model encounters an instance with a 58% likelihood of being a ""Yes"", it might classify it as a ""No"", even though it is actually a ""Yes"" (i.e., the potential client did subscribe to a term deposit).

Therefore, for the upcoming marketing campaign, it would be prudent for the bank to concentrate its efforts on March, September, October, and December. December, despite having the lowest marketing activity, should also be considered, as there may be underlying factors influencing client behavior during this period.")

    st.write("**2) Leveraging Seasonal Trends:** Our analysis indicates that potential clients showed a preference for subscribing to term deposits during the fall and winter seasons. Therefore, the next marketing campaign should strategically target its activities during these seasons to capitalize on this trend.")

    st.write("**3) Limiting Campaign Calls:** Implementing a policy restricting the number of calls to each potential client to a maximum of three can help conserve time and effort while also preventing potential client fatigue. It's crucial to remember that excessive calls to the same potential client can increase the likelihood of rejection for opening a term deposit.")

    st.write("**4) Targeting Age Segments:** To optimize the next marketing campaign, the bank should focus on two specific age brackets: individuals aged 20 or younger and those aged 60 or older. Our analysis indicates that the youngest category exhibited a 60% likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit, while the eldest category showed a 76% likelihood. By directing campaign efforts towards these age segments, the bank can potentially boost the number of term deposit subscriptions.")

    st.write("**5) Occupational Influence:** It comes as no surprise that students and retired individuals are among the most inclined to subscribe to a term deposit. Retired individuals often opt for term deposits to earn interest on their savings, as they are less likely to require immediate access to their funds. Term deposits function as short-term loans, where the individual, particularly retirees, agrees not to withdraw the deposited amount until a predetermined date. Subsequently, they receive both their initial capital and the accumulated interest. Given their tendency to be more conservative with their finances, retired individuals are inclined to invest their cash by lending it to financial institutions. Similarly, students are another demographic group known to subscribe to term deposits.")

    st.write("**6) Impact of House Loans and Balances:** Our analysis reveals that potential clients with low or no balances are more prone to having house loans compared to those in the average and high balance categories. Having a house loan implies that the individual has financial commitments to repay, leaving limited available funds for subscribing to a term deposit account. Conversely, potential clients with average and high balances are less likely to have house loans, making them more inclined to open a term deposit. Therefore, the upcoming marketing campaign should prioritize individuals with average and high balances to enhance the probability of term deposit subscriptions.")

    st.write("**7) Implementing a Questionnaire during Calls:** Given that the duration of the call positively correlates with the likelihood of a potential client opening a term deposit, introducing an engaging questionnaire during calls could potentially prolong the conversation. While this strategy does not guarantee term deposit subscriptions, it enhances engagement with potential clients, thereby increasing the likelihood of subscription. Implementing such a strategy incurs minimal risk while potentially improving the effectiveness of the bank's next marketing campaign.")

    st.write("**8) Focusing on High Duration Individuals:** Targeting individuals with a duration above the average threshold of 375 presents a lucrative opportunity, as this group exhibits a significantly higher likelihood of opening a term deposit account. With a probability of 78%, this target demographic shows considerable potential for term deposit subscriptions. By concentrating efforts on this high-duration group, the success rate of the next marketing campaign is poised to achieve remarkable success.")

    st.write("By integrating these strategies and refining the target audience for the next campaign, the bank can anticipate a higher level of effectiveness compared to the current one.")
