# 📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis & Prediction  

## Overview  
Marketing campaigns prioritize understanding customer needs and satisfaction. However, their success depends on multiple factors, requiring careful analysis and strategic planning. This project explores the **4 Ps of Marketing (Product, Price, Place, Promotion)** in the context of a **direct marketing campaign** by a Portuguese banking institution.  

The goal is to analyze customer interactions and build a predictive model to determine whether a client will subscribe to a **term deposit** based on past campaign data.  

## 🔍 Key Features  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding customer behavior and campaign performance  
✅ **Predictive Modeling**: Classification model to predict term deposit subscription  
✅ **Feature Engineering**: Handling categorical & numerical variables effectively  
✅ **Data Visualization**: Insights using Python libraries like Seaborn & Matplotlib  
✅ **Machine Learning**: Model training & evaluation for accurate predictions  

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of customer demographics, past interactions, and campaign-related attributes. It includes:  
- **Client Information**: Age, job, marital status, education, credit details  
- **Campaign Data**: Contact type, duration, number of previous contacts  
- **Historical Performance**: Outcome of past campaigns, days since last contact  
- **Target Variable**: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`)  

## 📊 Marketing & Business Context  
A **term deposit** is a financial product with a fixed interest rate for a specific period. Understanding customer behavior through data-driven insights helps optimize marketing efforts, improving conversion rates and campaign efficiency.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Data Processing**: Feature Engineering, Handling Missing Values  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
